## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Authentication System
- **Password Security:** bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Token:** JWT with 7-day expiration
- **Storage:** httpOnly cookie + Authorization header support
- **Middleware:** `authMiddleware` for protected routes

### Database Architecture (MongoDB Atlas)
- **Connection:** MongoDB Atlas Cloud (Cluster0)
- **Database Name:** `alpha-studio`
- **Collections:** 13 collections
  - `users` - User accounts with hashed passwords + balance
  - `courses` - Course information
  - `students` - Student profiles
  - `partners` - Partner profiles
  - `projects` - User projects
  - `studio_sessions` - AI studio session history
  - `transformations` - Available transformations
  - `api_usage` - API usage tracking
  - `transactions` - Payment transactions (topup, spend, refund, manual_topup, bonus)
  - `webhooklogs` - Casso webhook logs for debugging/reprocessing
  - `prompts` - Shared prompts with multiple contents, ratings, engagement
  - `resources` - Resource hub files with metadata and engagement
  - `comments` - Comments for prompts and resources
- **Documentation:** See DATABASE.md for detailed schema

### CORS Configuration
- Development: localhost:3000, localhost:5173, 127.0.0.1:5173
- Production defaults: `https://giaiphapsangtao.com`, `https://www.giaiphapsangtao.com`, `https://alphastudio.vercel.app`
- Extra production/staging origins: `FRONTEND_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL_PROD`, `FRONTEND_URLS`, or `CORS_ORIGINS`
- Supports credentials for cookie-based auth
- Methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS

### Admin Authorization
- **adminOnly middleware:** Checks `user.role === 'admin'`
- **Protected routes:** All /api/courses/* endpoints
- Returns 403 Forbidden for non-admin users

### Error Handling
- Centralized error middleware
- User-friendly error messages
- Duplicate key detection (MongoDB code 11000)
- Mongoose validation error handling

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Authentication System
- **Password Security:** bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Token:** JWT with 7-day expiration
- **Storage:** httpOnly cookie + Authorization header support
- **Middleware:** `authMiddleware` for protected routes

### Database Architecture (MongoDB Atlas)
- **Connection:** MongoDB Atlas Cloud (Cluster0)
- **Database Name:** `alpha-studio`
- **Collections:** 13 collections
  - `users` - User accounts with hashed passwords + balance
  - `courses` - Course information
  - `students` - Student profiles
  - `partners` - Partner profiles
  - `projects` - User projects
  - `studio_sessions` - AI studio session history
  - `transformations` - Available transformations
  - `api_usage` - API usage tracking
  - `transactions` - Payment transactions (topup, spend, refund, manual_topup, bonus)
  - `webhooklogs` - Casso webhook logs for debugging/reprocessing
  - `prompts` - Shared prompts with multiple contents, ratings, engagement
  - `resources` - Resource hub files with metadata and engagement
  - `comments` - Comments for prompts and resources
- **Documentation:** See DATABASE.md for detailed schema

### CORS Configuration
- Development: localhost:3000, localhost:5173, 127.0.0.1:5173
- Production defaults: `https://giaiphapsangtao.com`, `https://www.giaiphapsangtao.com`, `https://alphastudio.vercel.app`
- Extra production/staging origins: `FRONTEND_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL_PROD`, `FRONTEND_URLS`, or `CORS_ORIGINS`
- Supports credentials for cookie-based auth
- Methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS

### Admin Authorization
- **adminOnly middleware:** Checks `user.role === 'admin'`
- **Protected routes:** All /api/courses/* endpoints
- Returns 403 Forbidden for non-admin users

### Error Handling
- Centralized error middleware
- User-friendly error messages
- Duplicate key detection (MongoDB code 11000)
- Mongoose validation error handling

| AI Consultation Chat | ✅ Complete | models/ChatMessage.js, routes/chat.js, routes/settings.js, utils/aiProvider.js, server/context/alpha-studio-bot | `POST /chat/send` saves user msg then routes via admin setting `useOpenClawForChat`: OpenClaw (`OPENCLAW_URL`, session memory) by default, or direct gcli (`GCLI_DIRECT_URL`) with bundled Alpha Studio workspace context and up to 3 previous MongoDB chat messages. `GET /chat/history` display history; `DELETE /chat/history` clears DB history. |
| VocabFlip Integration | ✅ Complete (Phase 15) | models/Vocab.js, routes/vocab.js, scripts/release-vocabflip-to-b2.js | MongoDB-backed public/private deck storage remains in `routes/vocab.js`; release metadata is exposed at `GET /api/vocab/releases/latest` with `vocab_latest_release` override and B2 fallback. Release automation builds VocabFlip APK, Windows ZIP, and Web assets, uploads binaries to `vocabflip-app/releases/`, and updates `vocabflip-app/version.json`. |
| Interior Design AI API | ✅ Complete | models/InteriorProject.js, routes/interior.js, utils/aiProvider.js, routes/chat.js | Auth-gated `/api/interior` project CRUD, AI chat, version persistence, rollback, manual cabinetModel validation, 1-credit charge per valid AI response, admin/mod bypass. Reuses `useOpenClawForChat` provider toggle shared with `/api/chat/send`. |
| Interior AI Prompt v2 + 2-step | ✅ Complete | routes/interior.js, models/User.js, models/InteriorProject.js, routes/auth.js, utils/templateValidator.js, utils/interiorCatalogPrompt.js, utils/interiorTemplateAssets.js, utils/interiorModelGeometry.js | (A) Prompt v2: few-shot, domain hints (kích thước/vật liệu chuẩn VN), Phase 10 strict dimension anchor, `/chat` `runs[]` rule for L/U/island/parallel layouts, z-axis wall-depth convention, forced reply format "Quan sát ảnh/Hiểu yêu cầu/Đã áp dụng", lower askForInfo threshold. Phase B builds `/chat`, proposal, and agent catalog sections from `InteriorTemplate` seed/approved DB rows with 5-minute cache, auto-seeds built-ins + workshop components at startup, normalizes workshop face aliases, and uses template-first few-shot examples. Phase C adds renderable palette/token guidance, per-module `style.colors` prompt rules, unknown `$token` validation for import/tplNew, tplNew normalization through the same ingest helper, and updated agent `model.setPalette` support for new palettes. Phase D applies `tpl` dimensions from DB/inline `params.default`, attaches non-blocking geometry warnings (run length, bounds, overlap, upper-vs-lower z), retries `/chat` apply once with a focused repair prompt when warnings exist, and returns warning/repair metadata while saving schema-valid models. Phase E adds detail-density rules to chat/proposal/agent/analyze prompts so modules include visible fronts, handles, countertops/backsplashes, wardrobe rods/shelves, sliding tracks/rollers, and glass shelves. Phase 14 template instructions require `boxes` only for new `tplNew` payloads, while validator accepts legacy `isoBoxes` and rejects SVG view fields. (B) Opt-in `User.preferences.interiorTwoStepConfirm` (set via `PUT /auth/profile`). When ON, `POST /interior/projects/:id/chat` accepts `stage='proposal'\|'apply'`: proposal returns plain-text analysis (1 credit, no version), apply consumes `proposalText` as context (1 credit, creates version). Total 2 credit/lần khi bật. |
| Interior Image-to-Design (Phase 4+) | ✅ Complete | routes/interior.js (+/analyze-image, +/generate-render), middleware/interiorQuota.js, models/{InteriorAnalysis,InteriorRender,InteriorQuota}.js, routes/admin.js (orphan scan) | `POST /interior/analyze-image` (auth + 5/24h quota): JSON body `{imageUrl, hints, modelOverride}`, sha256 cache (24h TTL), Gemini Flash 3 default → Pro 3.1 escalate, 2-attempt JSON repair loop, returns `{model, suggestedModel, meta}`. Prompt teaches Phase 8 `runs[]` for L/U/island/galley layouts and detail-density rules; validator accepts either legacy `modules[]` or new `runs[]`, not both. `POST /interior/generate-render` validates `modelJson`, stores the iso PNG conditioning image, calls Gemini image generation (`INTERIOR_IMAGE_API_KEY`/`GEMINI_API_KEY` or Admin Gemini key), uploads generated output to B2, persists `InteriorRender`, and falls back to the conditioning URL with `meta.pending=true` if no key/upstream failure occurs. Default project model now uses an opaque solid panel template instead of transparent zone modules. |
| Interior Assets Bundle (Fly deploy) | ✅ Complete | scripts/sync-interior-assets.mjs, server/assets/interior/{templates,workshop,skills}, utils/interiorTemplateAssets.js, routes/interior.js, package.json | Docker image chỉ COPY `server/`, nên seed/skills đọc từ `tools/` bị thiếu trên Fly. `npm run sync:interior-assets` copy 14 template + manifest, 42 workshop component, 6 agent skill vào `server/assets/interior/`. Runtime ưu tiên `tools/` (dev), fallback assets bundle (deploy). **Chạy lại sync trước mỗi lần deploy nếu template/component/skill thay đổi.** |
| Interior Run Coordinate Unification | ✅ Complete | utils/interiorModelGeometry.js, routes/interior.js (INTERIOR_RUNS_RULE_VI + few-shot), engine `src/core/model.js`, skills kitchen-l-shape/kitchen-galley | Quy ước thống nhất mọi hướng run: module `x` = vị trí DỌC trục run từ origin, `z` = offset vuông góc từ tường (engine trước đây dùng z làm trục đi cho north/south → nhánh L render ra ngoài model). Occupied-length check giờ chỉ cảnh báo overshoot với model đa run (undershoot hợp lệ vì khối góc thuộc run kia). Few-shot chữ L viết lại: return run `south` origin {0,0} chứa corner, main run east origin {x:100} — verified 0 geometry warnings + in-bounds + no overlaps. |
| Interior Component Workshop Cleanup | ✅ Complete | routes/interior.js, tools/interior-component-workshop/component-library.js | `POST /api/interior/workshop/components/delete` deletes selected local Workshop `components/<id>.json` files and regenerates `data/template-bundle.js`. It is enabled only in local/dev (or `INTERIOR_WORKSHOP_DELETE_ENABLED=true`) and only accepts loopback requests from no origin, `Origin: null`, localhost, or 127.0.0.1; no Bearer token is required for this local cleanup endpoint. |
| Interior Workshop File-Origin CORS | ✅ Complete | server/index.js | `Origin: null` from `file://` workshop pages is now treated as an allowed CORS origin instead of logging `CORS blocked origin: null`. Local workshop origins on localhost/127.0.0.1 are also explicitly allowed. |
| Interior AI Log Viewer | ✅ Complete | models/InteriorAiLog.js, routes/interior.js, scripts/dump-interior-log.mjs | Every `/api/interior/projects/:id/chat` call (both `proposal` and `apply` stages) records raw prompt, ref images, raw AI response, parsed reply, latency, usage, status (`ok`/`parse-failed`/`validation-failed`/`upstream-error`), errorMessage. TTL 30 days. `GET /api/interior/admin/logs?projectId=&userId=&stage=&status=&limit=` accepts EITHER (auth + adminOnly) OR header `x-reviewer-token: $INTERIOR_LOG_REVIEWER_TOKEN` (reviewer bypass for ops/debug). Direct dump: `node scripts/dump-interior-log.mjs <projectId>`. |

### Recent CRM Subscription Note

- New user registration (`POST /api/auth/register`) creates a one-time `crm_trial` subscription: 14 days, 100 included AI requests, 0 used, 0 extra, `entitlementType: trial`.
- `CrmSubscription` has `entitlementType` and `trialStartedAt`; partial unique index `unique_trial_subscription_per_user` prevents a second trial for the same user.
- CRM checkout/billing fulfillment preserves the historical trial record; upgrading from trial closes that trial and creates a separate `entitlementType: paid` subscription, while paid renewals extend the paid record in place.

### Group AI Summary (structured + incremental, privacy-first)

- **Backend does NOT store group message content.** The `events/message` ingest no longer creates `CrmGroupMessage` (only updates `CrmZaloGroup.lastMessageAt`). The Flutter client reads messages from the operator's **local** store and sends them in the request body; they are used transiently for AI only and never persisted.
- `POST /crm/groups/:id/summarize` accepts `{ messages:[{senderName,content,sentAt}], scope, goals[], prompt, industry, autoCreateTasks, saveConfig }`. Messages come from `req.body` (sorted, phone-redacted, capped 400); incremental watermark (latest summary `coveredTo`) is applied client-side. `CrmGroupMessage` model still exists but is no longer written (legacy `/groups/:id/messages` + `/checkpoints` now return empty).
- AI returns structured JSON parsed by `utils/crmGroupSummary.js` (`buildGroupSummaryPromptV2` + `parseGroupSummaryJson`, prose fallback). `CrmGroupSummary` gained `coveredFrom/coveredTo/messageCount`.
- Opportunities/risks/questions/actionItems become `CrmGroupInsight` upserted by `dedupKey` (`dedupKeyForItem`, normalized diacritics) — already-`done`/`dismissed` items are not recreated, giving skip-done continuity. Follow-up insights → tasks via `POST /crm/tasks` (`relatedType:'insight'`, `insightId`).
- Per-group wizard config persists on `CrmZaloGroup.summaryConfig` (Mixed) via `PUT /crm/groups/:id/manage`.
- `GET /crm/tasks` now also `.populate('groupId', 'name accountId groupId')` so care tasks carry the linked Zalo group (name + accountId + groupId) for display and the client's "Mở Live Chat" deep-link.
- **Summary model is a LOCAL client preference** (stored in Flutter `SystemSettings.summaryAiModel`, no cloud setting/endpoint): the client sends `aiModel` in the summarize body; the route validates via `normalizeSummaryAiModel` (allowed: `gemini-3.1-pro` default, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-3-flash`) and passes `model` + `quotaUnits` (`getChatbotModelQuotaUnits`: pro-3.1 = 2 units, others = 1).
- Each summarize writes a `CrmChatbotLog` (`kind:'group_summary'`, `tokenIn`/`tokenOut` from `CrmAiUsage`) so it shows in the chatbot "Nhật ký phản hồi". `CrmChatbotLog` gained `kind`/`tokenIn`/`tokenOut`.
- `GET /crm/analytics/ai-tokens?from=&to=` aggregates `CrmAiUsage` daily token in/out (prompt/completion) for the overview chart.

### CRM Realtime (SSE) for Mobile/Web clients

- `server/utils/crmEventHub.js`: in-memory per-userId SSE hub (`subscribe(userId,res)`, `publish(userId,eventName,payload)`, 25s ping heartbeat, max 5 connections/user). Single Fly.io instance only — needs Redis pub/sub if scaled horizontally.
- `GET /crm/events/subscribe` (`authMiddleware`-based `sseAuthMiddleware` that also accepts `?token=` for EventSource/web, `requireActiveSubscription`): sends `hello` (serverTime + active devices) then streams `message.new`, `message.status`, `conversation.updated`, `device.status`, `pairing.completed`.
- Broadcast points: `POST /agent/events/message` (message.new + conversation.updated), `POST /agent/commands/:id/result` for `zalo.message.send` (message.status, reuses the existing `CrmMessage` status update), `POST /conversations/:id/send`+`/send-attachment` (message.status queued), `POST /pairing/confirm` (pairing.completed).
- `CrmDevice` heartbeat gained `agentStatus`/`zaloAccounts`/`queueDepth`/`lastHeartbeatAt`; `POST /agent/heartbeat` publishes `device.status` on transition. A 30s `setInterval` in `server/index.js` marks devices offline (and publishes) after 60s without a heartbeat.
- `POST /agent/commands/next` now long-polls: body `waitMs` (capped 25000ms) holds the request until a command is created for that device (`createAgentCommand()` helper wraps `CrmAgentCommand.create` + wakes the waiter) or the timeout elapses; omitting `waitMs` keeps the old immediate-return behavior.
- Desktop Windows app is unaffected — it still uses its local bridge SSE, not this cloud channel. This cloud SSE + long-poll pair targets mobile/web clients that have no local bridge (see `tools/alpha-crm/docs/specs/mobile-web-completion-tasklist.md`).
- **BE-6 (outbound message sync):** `upsertConversationFromInbound` (used by `POST /agent/events/message`) now tells inbound vs outbound apart via `event.senderId === accountId` (the agent always sets this for its own sends) instead of hardcoding `direction: 'inbound'`. Outbound: `unreadCount` is never incremented, and the message is stored (with real content for 1:1 threads) even when `LOCAL_FIRST_LIVE_CHAT=true` — that flag only suppresses full **inbound** history from the cloud, not the operator/chatbot's own sent messages. No separate `/agent/events/outbound-message` endpoint was added (deviation from the original task doc): reusing the same endpoint with direction auto-detection was simpler and avoided duplicating ~150 lines of conversation-upsert/managed-group logic. `GET /conversations/:id/messages` no longer returns `LOCAL_BRIDGE_REQUIRED`; it returns whatever's synced plus `meta.syncScope` (`'full'` or `'outbound-and-synced-only'`).
- **Known limitation (unchanged from local-first design):** inbound customer replies are still reported metadata-only (`reportInboundMessageMetadata`, `localFirst:true`) by the desktop agent, so cloud message history for a conversation is outbound-only until/unless a future change decides to also sync inbound content — full history stays on the Desktop Agent by design (see tasklist's Known Limitations #1).
- **BE-7 (mobile command-authorization review, closes Task 1.3-security):** audited every route that creates a `CrmAgentCommand` (`/conversations/:id/send`, `/send-attachment`, `/messages/:messageId/recall`, `/campaigns/:id/start`, `/campaigns/:id/cancel`) — all require `authMiddleware` + `requireActiveSubscription`, and each independently re-fetches its target (`CrmConversation`/`CrmCampaign`/`CrmDevice`) scoped to `userId: req.user._id` before calling `createAgentCommand()`, which itself trusts the caller's `userId`/`deviceId` with no independent re-check. Cross-user access returns **404** (not 403) so a user can't distinguish "not yours" from "doesn't exist" — a deliberate anti-enumeration choice, not a gap (the tasklist's DoD phrasing said "test 403"; 404 is the stricter, correct behavior here). **Decision: no per-command JWT signature needed** — the agent already authenticates via `x-agent-secret` + `deviceId` (`agentAuthMiddleware`), and every command a device can claim was already scoped to that device's owner at creation time; adding per-command signing would duplicate protection the ownership check already provides. Added `crmMessageSendLimiter` (30 req/min) to `/conversations/:id/send` and `/send-attachment` — the only unthrottled command-creating routes reachable directly from a mobile/web client (campaigns already require human approval + are lower-frequency by nature).

## 5. Known Issues & TODOs

### High Priority
- [x] Rate limiting: implemented per-route in `server/middleware/crmRateLimit.js` (pairing, device register, AI chat, CRM message send). Not a global/all-routes limiter — add new limiters there as new abuse-prone routes are added.
- [ ] Input sanitization could be improved
- [ ] **gcli model codes (tạm thời):** model `-preview` của gcli hiện không khả dụng. `utils/aiProvider.js` có `GCLI_MODEL_CODE_MAP` dịch tên UI (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-3-flash`, `gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.1-pro`) → mã `假流式-agy-*-low` ngay tại `callGcliDirect` (choke point duy nhất cho mọi tool: chat/crm/interior/ai). Khi gọi đến `gemini-3-flash-preview` và `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, có tỷ lệ 20% sẽ dùng `假流式-agy-gemini-3-flash-low` và `假流式-agy-gemini-3.1-pro-low` (có thể tắt qua `disableLowModelFallback: true` hoặc `enableLowModelFallback: false` trong options gọi API, mặc định luôn bật). Khôi phục: sửa value trong map về mã `-preview`.

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Forgot password / password reset not implemented
- [ ] Email verification not implemented
- [ ] No testing framework configured
- [ ] No ESLint/Prettier configuration

### Low Priority
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Request logging to file
- [ ] Database indexes optimization
